#FIRST Team 1073 Team Handbooks

A collection of handbooks and rules we've defined as a FIRST Team over the years.
I hope this will become a good resource for rookie and veteran teams alike :)

##Adding your own team's handbook

1. Fork the repository 
2. Clone it
3. Make a folder with your team number - be sure to put your team's year in the file name too!
4. Populate it with your team's handbooks 
5. Push it to GitHub and submit a pull request 
6. I'll happily accept it
